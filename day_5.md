## 🤖 Day 5 Notes: Using AI to Assist with Data Projects

### 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

* Understand how to use AI tools like ChatGPT to help with coding
* Write effective prompts to get the help you need
* Use AI to write, debug, and improve your data analysis scripts
* Collaborate with AI for scraping, cleaning, and visualizing data

---

### 🧠 1. What is ChatGPT and How Can It Help?

ChatGPT is an AI assistant that can:

* Explain Python code
* Suggest fixes for errors
* Write or complete scripts
* Generate charts from your data
* Help with documentation or comments

---

### 📝 2. Prompt Engineering Basics

How to ask AI for help effectively:

* Be specific: “Help me write a function to filter prices > 5”
* Give context: Include a snippet of your code
* Ask for explanation: “Explain what this error means”

---

### 🔍 3. Using AI for Scraping and Analysis

* Generate Playwright selectors from HTML
* Suggest improvements to scraping logic
* Ask AI to refactor or comment your scraping script

---

### 📊 4. Using AI for Cleaning and Visualization

* Ask AI to fill missing data or rename columns
* Request chart code with titles, colors, or labels
* Use AI to generate multiple chart types quickly

---

### ✏️ Mini Project Challenge

**Goal:** Use AI to build a complete mini-project

1. Use AI to help write a scraper or use your previous one
2. Clean and analyze the data using Pandas
3. Visualize the results with charts
4. Present your insights (short write-up or demo)

---

### ✅ Summary

* AI can accelerate your work and deepen understanding
* You need to guide it with clear, focused prompts
* Use it as a collaborator, not just a code generator
